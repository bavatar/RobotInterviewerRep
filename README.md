# Week7Challenge-CraigsJobsList

This application has met all the requirements and has the following bonus (extra credit) features:
* a robust DataLoader was developed and used to pre-populate the database. 
  The DataLoader will check for the existence of the admin account.  If it exists then the DataLoader will not be rerun unnecessarily.
* The ADMIN role was given the ability to search through the database.
  The search queries on partial words and every word separated by a space to collect a larger set of results.
* Administrative user management functionality was added and restricted to the ADMIN role.
